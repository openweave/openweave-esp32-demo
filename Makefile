#    Description:
#      Top-level makefile for building the OpenWeave ESP32 demo application using
#      the Espressif ESP-IDF development environment.
#

# Project Name
PROJECT_NAME            := openweave-esp32-demo

# Location of the openweave-esp32-lwip source tree.
#
# OpenWeave requires an enhanced version of the LwIP library that comes with the ESP-IDF.
# development environment.  This version, known as openweave-esp32-lwip, is incorprated
# into the demo application as a git submodule.
#
# Because of the way the OpenWeave code builds, the component.mk file for OpenWeave
# needs to know the location of openweave-esp32-lwip within the overall project source
# tree.  To achieve this we use the LWIP_COMPONENT_DIR variable to convey the location
# of openweave-esp32-lwip to the included OpenWeave component makefile. 
#  
LWIP_COMPONENT_DIR       = $(PROJECT_PATH)/third_party/lwip
export LWIP_COMPONENT_DIR

# A list of directories containing third-party (i.e. external) components that are used
# by the demo application.  These are incorporated as git submodules in the source tree.
